               <h2>There is thing called Rock Climbing</h2>
               <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">Rock climbing. Perhaps you’ve heard of it. This niche sport where the athletics feel compelled to ascend a rock wall, chasing down a wave of accomplishment. What you may not know, is that there are 3 main disciplines to outdoor rock climbing. Traditional, sport, and bouldering. (Let’s just ignore ice climbing for today)</p>
               <dl>
                  <dt>Traditional Climbing</dt>
                  <figure>

                  </figure>
                  <dd>Traditional climbing is the oldest of them all. As the climbers proceed up the wall, they are placing various types of anchors into the rock. These could be single nuts, spring loaded cams, chocks,  fixed pitons or using natural features to create anchors with slings and/or webbing. Such as a tree or rock that meets the criteria needed. Essentially the thing to remember here, is that the climber is placing their own points of protection, the anchors. Which means, the climbers must carry the extra weight of their “rack” or collection of gear on their harness. Thus it the climbing process is a much slower pace.</dd>

                  <dt>Sport Climbing</dt>
                  <figure>

                  </figure>
                  <dd>Sport climbing is the offspring of traditional climbing. However fixed anchors have already been placed along the route. Typically these consist of steel bolts that are specifically graded for outdoor climbing. The lead climber simply has to place one bit of gear and attach their rope before continuing on. Accelerating the overall process and decreasing the amount of weight placed upon the climbers. Allowing the climbs to increase in difficulty, among other things. Essentially stream lining trad. climbing. </dd>

                  <dt>Bouldering</dt>

                  <dd>Bouldering. It is exactly what it sounds like. You climb a boulder. This means, less moves, yet moves requiring more effort. This discipline was born out of the desire to train for the most challenging points of big wall routes. These shorter climbs on boulders ended up being called, “problems.” As they often presented a mental and physical  puzzle for the climber to solve. With bouldering there isn’t a rope. The safety gear utitlized is crash pads and spotters to ensure the climber lands in a stable way.</dd>

               <p>Now that you have some idea what each discipline is, I shall attempt to enlighten you as to why you should bother to boulder! Bouldering is best! That’s why!
                  Okay, okay…there is more to it than that. First we need to dive into what the outdoor bouldering experience really is.
                  </p>
               <P>Let's jump ahead to the arrival at the parking lot of the crag. We collect our gear. Crash pads, climbing shoes, chalk bucket, snacks, and perhaps a camera. Then you hike a short to moderate distance to the boulders that you wish to climb. In my experience it’s never more than a mile hike.</P>
               <p>The first couple of climbs may be at a warmup boulder. Or just in general on easier climbs. Then as the day proceeds you transition to your project or other harder climbs. Overall you spend most of the of time on the ground, resting, just hanging out enjoying nature. Perhaps contemplating how to solve the boulder “problem”. Discussing strategies with your fellow climbers. Each time you climb, you may only spend 10-30 seconds on the wall. But in those fleeting moments, you will be pushing, pulling, smearing, twisting with tremendous amounts of effort. Then should you be so lucky as to get a send. A rush of achievement will find you atop that boulder. A strange joy. Yet feels primal. Like it belongs. </p>
               <p>Finding the actual boulder problems in an area can be confusing. Here is where having a proper mentor to guide you through the process is truly a blessing. The next best thing is a guide book or other online resources. Even then, it can feel like looking at a Where’s Waldo book, when searching for a boulder problem. If it’s a crag that isn’t so popular, you may end up having to clean the holds you wish to utilize, inspecting the top out, removing any build up on slip hazards. Leafs, twigs, moss. This is all with the assumption we are climbing established routes in an acceptable climbing area. Otherwise, creating your own route outside, bouldering or not. Is an entirely different series of steps to follow. </p>

               <p>This is where the creation of climbing gyms have eased the pain of being an absolute beginner. </p>

               <h2>The Perimeter</h2>

               <p>The development of climbing gyms vastly changed the sport. Giving climbers a chance to hone their technique and strength, unaffected by the weather. Allowing new climbers to grow in strength rapidly, however also offsetting the immediate outdoor experience many had to grow into in previous decades. The era of the gym climber was born. Most gyms will have a mixture of sport, top-rope and bouldering areas. It’s around the bouldering pad, that the real action is at. Social action that is. </p>
               <p>Lined up chaoticly around the perimeter of every indoor bouldering area, are climbers from varying backgrounds, Old, young, beginners, local crushers. All for singular purpose. Yes! To climb. But also a hidden agena! To socialize.</p>
               <p>It’s the perimeter of the bouldering pad where, in my humble opinion, the community grows. It’s not out in the rope climbing areas where it’s all cliches or pairs of climbers. It’s around the bouldering pad, that you suddenly find your self discussing beta for a particular climb with random person, as if you have been old friends. The experienced climbers always there to share advice for the newer ones. The environment feels very casual yet people are all putting in massive efforts on the wall.</p>
               <p>I suppose I should mention indoor climbing is much easier than outdoor. Another reason gyms have made it easier to dip your toes into the water. The nicely colored plastic holds, perfect landing and a range of difficulty that lets you stay within your comfort zone. It’s all about baby steps, not unlike weight lifting. The point is never to completely tear down your muscles, but start small and gradually accept more challenging routes.</p>

               <h2>Why Bother?</h2>
               <p>If you answer yes to the following question, then you should leave now for your nearest climbing gym. </p>
               <ul>
                  <li>Do you enjoy the outdoors? </li>
                  <li>Do you need a new social scene?</li>
                  <li>Do you want to meet new people, with healthy outlook on life?</li>
                  <li>Hate the regular gym, but want a fun new way to exercise?</li>
                  <li>Are you looking to improve your balance, coordination, strength within a sport that can be low or high impact?</li>
               </ul>

            <section id="conclusion">
               <h2>Just Climb Already</h2>
               <p>At the end of the day. Climbing helped pull my mental state out of the trenches and made me excited to exercise again. To experience nature in a new way. Bouldering, with it’s gymnmastic like movements, spoke to me. I was instantly hooked once i realized what the sport was. It helped that I already knew highly skilled climbers that took me under their wing. </p>
               <p>And it doesn’t have to be bouldering….though it is the best. If you are older, or in general looking for low impact activity, top-rope climbing would be more your speed. Regardless, climbing is truly a jovial activity with a quirky unique community. That’s all folks. </p>
